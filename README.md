# Multi Components Lab

## Brief
Your task is to create an app that shows info for all the countries using multiple components. Use the Countries API to make a request to get the data.

## MVP
- Display a list of country names.
- Add a click event to the list item which should then render more detail about that country (name, capital, population).
- Use reusable components.
